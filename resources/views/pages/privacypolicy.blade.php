                    <h2>1.What, Why and How</h2>
                <p>A cookie and similar tracking technologies such as tags, scripts and beacons are small files (hereafter referred to as cookies) downloaded on to your device when you access most websites and allows sites to recognise the device if it makes a return visit.</p>
                <p>There are different types of cookies used for different purposes. There are cookies where we give you the option to opt in/ opt out but there are some that are essential. As laid out in the Terms and Condition statement, we cannot control other websites.</p>
                <p>A cookie might be stored on your browser:</p>
                <p>To make sure the website can function properly<br />
                    To enable you to make use of the secure online services we provide<br />
                    To collect anonymous information where available about the users journey, IP address, device IDs and preferences which helps us improve our online offering and marketing<br />
                    To make advertising and promotional offers more effective.<br />
                    To remember your preferences and make the site easier for you to access<br />
                    Information collected by cookies will remain anonymous - if the collected data is ever merged with any other, personally identifiable information, which you have provided us (such as email address) the cookies are anonymised.</p>
                <p>Some cookies are retained in your browser for the period you are on our website, some persist for longer specified/ unspecified periods.</p>
                <h2>2. Types of cookies</h2>
                <p>Pre-session cookies: these are cookies that help maintain security and store information while you are using our site. They are only stored while you are using our website and they are deleted when you leave the site.<br />
                    Persistent cookies: these cookies have an expiration date and will stay on your device until they are deleted or expire.<br />
                    First/ Third Party Cookies: The difference between a first or third party cookie will depend on the domain/ website placing the cookie. A first party cookie is a cookie that has been placed on the user&rsquo;s device by a domain the user has visited. A third party cookie is placed by a domain other than the one the user has visited. For example if you visit our site and another company drops a pixel, this would be considered a third party pixel.</p>

                <p>Chartbeat</p>
                <p>Analytics</p>
                <p>A sustainable web demands we measure and monetize attention. Since the web's creation, the standard unit of success has been the click. Yet the goal of content creation has always been to get the right information to the right people and have them consume it, understand it, learn from it. This massive disconnect of goals and metrics has led to a web that rewards empty traffic, clickbait headlines, and billions of unseen ad impressions. Chartbeat is changing that. We quantify the value between the clicks. We partner with editorial teams to identify their highest quality content -- the pieces that pique and keep reader attention. We partner with advertising teams to plan campaigns around this high-quality content so these ads are seen more often and for longer. This shift to valuing and transacting on the time people are paying attention means publishers creating quality content get paid more for it, brands get the time in front of an attentive audience they're paying for, and readers get the best user experience possible. http://chartbeat.com/privacy/</p>
